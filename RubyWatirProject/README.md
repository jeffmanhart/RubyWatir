quality
=======

A place for testers to keep and share all of their test files.

Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort. There must be the will to produce a superior thing. - John Ruskin

To Do list for casperJs stuffs

  * Update navigation files to check for extra div caused by navigating to the user stories page.
  * Add more data to mongo database, set it up for each data type.  Figure out a way to have datasets.
  * Flesh out the UI component to process the casper scripts.
  * Add ability to update the mongo database test data from the UI.




Test for Flowdock's Github Integration Test 3


## Functional Automation wishlist
A list of things to consider when looking at automation tools.

* Use a full fledged programming language proprietry language would be less desirable
* Utilizes selenium-webdriver in some capacity reguardless of language
* Preferably open source
* Image comparision
* Image find an click
* Support for keyword driven or Behavior Driven development use of modules functions and page objects 
* Promotes understanding of what is being tested
* Should not be tightly coupled with SUT
* Infastructure automation should verify the correctness of the application built
* Some sort of reporting that makes it easy to deciper what went wrong and where to look
  and should be clear enough to reproduce the test  manually to verify breakage
* Can handle latency and timing issues
* Has potentential to generate the data the test needs
* Can ask for data to use on the front end
* Some plan to deal with concurrency and multiple tabs/windows running app
* Has some method to deal with manual integration
* Tests can be run against all supported browsers or headless browser
* Can create reusable tests and actions
* Can run tests against test clusters or a static test environment
* Can be used by all QA employees for their projects that choose with minimal training
  *Flowdock, waffle, and ALM all have different needs

## Functional Automation Tools to experiment
* Watir
*- PageObject Gem
